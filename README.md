# READ FIRST - About this fork

This is a modified version of Moonlight for Android.
It adds an optional accessibility service that simulates screen input to keep the display at max refresh rate.

This is useful for devices that cannot force the highest refresh rate via system settings.

Some devices (like the Huawei Mate XT global EMUI) have this option, but it is broken and doesn't do anything.

[Download latest version](https://github.com/tj81/moonlight-android/releases)

The accessibility service is implemented very passively and there is no additional battery drain while Moonlight is not active.

## HowTo

The accessibility service must be activated in Android settings.

## Possible drawbacks

Screen input like gestures not targetting Moonlight might be unreliable from time to time.
This happens when Moonlight fails to stop its periodic touch inputs fast enough.

Please note that some other apps behave slightly different when an accessibility service is active (like browsers no longer hiding their title bar).
